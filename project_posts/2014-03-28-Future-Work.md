Due to time reasons, this project hasn't been completely finished yet. There are more ideas that having not been implemented in the current project, which includes:

1. Extracting more features of river for generating melody. (What really characterizes a river?)

2. Introducing chords according to tributaries. (Multiple river sources detection and so on.)

3. Introducing more timbres. (Only piano is available right now.)

4. Introducing rhythmic variation. (Symphony!)
