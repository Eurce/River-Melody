## Description
The nature has its own regulation and sound, therefore we want to redefine the regulation, through setting up rules to recreate the sound of nature. Among all beauties, rivers are an important part of the nature, just like the human meridian, containing various variation and complexity that conceals its reality.

The shape of each river is unique, so is the melody. Thus the characteristics of each river could be revealed in the form of music. The allocated musical notes are defined by the river characteristics. All we have done is to set up a group of rules, which define how to translate river into melody. With the combination of visual river flow and auditory melody, a new language is born.

1. Download and display the specific google map image according to the given longitude, latitude and Z values:

2. Mark up the pixels that have river color:

3. Conduct dilation and erosion several times to shape the river (erasing bridges and small tributaries):

4. Highlight the river, and find out the upstream and downstream side:

5. Pixelize the river region and allocate musical notes, get ready for the melody stream:

6. The stream flows from the upstream to the downstream of the river. The musical pixels will be illuminated and sound up as the stream arrives:

7. The speed of stream flow is maintained at certain level, with the melody of river flowing homogeneously as well:

8. The stream is finished, as well as the melody.
