Sample procedure:

![Example Image](project_images/sample_1.png?raw=true "Example Image")

2. Mark up the pixels that have river color:
![Example Image](project_images/sample_2.png?raw=true "Example Image")

3. Conduct dilation and erosion several times to shape the river (erasing bridges and small tributaries):
![Example Image](project_images/sample_3.png?raw=true "Example Image")

4. Highlight the river, and find out the upstream and downstream side:
![Example Image](project_images/sample_4.png?raw=true "Example Image")

5. Pixelize the river region and allocate musical notes, get ready for the melody stream:
![Example Image](project_images/sample_5.png?raw=true "Example Image")

6. The stream flows from the upstream to the downstream of the river. The musical pixels will be illuminated and sound up as the stream arrives:
![Example Image](project_images/sample_6.png?raw=true "Example Image")

7. The speed of stream flow is maintained at certain level, with the melody of river flowing homogeneously as well:
